# Blockchain Development
This repository contains some simple codes for blockchain developed with Python using libraries like hashlib, datetime, json, flask, requests, uuid, urllib, etc.

A protocol/coin called chriscoin was created for the blockchain.

This blockchain uses Proof-Of-Work(POW) as its concensus protocol, where each node(miner) has to solve a cryptographic puzzle to get the nonce to create the next block of transactions.

Furthermore, a simple smart contract was developed with Solidity for the Ethereum network. This smart contract is a token with total supply of 1 million tokens.
